    "**Machine learning** (ML) has become a powerful tool for analyzing and predicting crime, enabling law enforcement agencies to enhance their crime prevention strategies through data-driven insights. By leveraging large volumes of historical crime data, ML algorithms can uncover patterns and correlations that may not be immediately evident to human analysts. When combined with geospatial risk models, which account for geographic and temporal factors, these algorithms can forecast the likelihood of crimes occurring in specific areas. This predictive capability allows for more efficient resource allocation, focused patrols in high-risk areas, and a proactive approach to crime prevention.\n",

    "**Geospatial risk models** integrate diverse data sources, such as socioeconomic indicators, weather patterns, and local crime reports, to predict the location and timing of future criminal activity. These models apply spatial analysis techniques to identify crime hotspots, assess neighborhood-level trends, and evaluate risk factors associated with different types of crimes.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, these approaches have notable limitations. One concern is the potential for bias in historical data, which can reflect discriminatory practices such as racial profiling, leading to the unfair targeting of certain communities. Additionally, focusing law enforcement efforts on areas flagged by these models may create feedback loops, where over-policing inflates crime data in those locations. This selection bias can skew predictions and limit the model’s effectiveness, particularly in identifying latent risks in underreported areas.\n",

    "In this project, **we aim to develop a statistical model to predict assault incidents across Chicago neighborhoods**. Initially, we considered using a random forest approach, which is effective for handling complex, non-linear relationships. However, given that our goal is to predict counts of crime incidents, we have opted for a **Poisson regression model** instead. Poisson regression is particularly suitable for modeling count data, such as the number of assault incidents in specific areas, and accounts for the underlying distribution of crime occurrences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our model will consider a range of geospatial *and* socioeconomic factors to capture the spatial trends of assaults across different neighborhoods. We acknowledge that assault data is influenced by selection bias, as not all incidents are reported, and increased police presence in historically high-crime areas can lead to over-reporting. Additionally, we hypothesize that proximity to certain factors—such as urban decay or community resources like schools or parks—plays a significant role in crime risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "By developing and evaluating a Poisson regression model, we aim to identify the most significant predictors of assault risk. This predictive framework will allow for more efficient resource allocation, focused interventions in high-risk areas, and a proactive approach to crime prevention. Ultimately, this approach supports public safety efforts by reducing crime through targeted strategies and helping law enforcement anticipate and mitigate criminal incidents.\n"
